Tools used for the processing and analysis of HYCOM and other lab projects

# What is this for?
- Hi all, this is just a bit of a playground for us to share and develop the various routines we use for HYCOM and our other spin-off projects. Here we can store and maintain working code that will be useful to others and enable us to work more efficently. Apologies if some of the code is matlab - I'm still busy with the python conversion!
